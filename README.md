A REST API for semantic search over documentation.
Index any text content, ask natural language questions, and get LLM-generated answers grounded on retrieved context — with source references and relevance scores.

Built with **FastAPI**, **ChromaDB**, **ONNX Runtime** embeddings, and **Claude** as the reasoning layer.

---

## The problem

Keyword search breaks on documentation. A user searches for *"how to handle payment failures"* but the relevant paragraph says *"retry logic for declined transactions"* — zero keyword overlap, relevant content missed.

Semantic search solves this by encoding content and queries into the same vector space and finding chunks by *meaning*, not by word match. The LLM then synthesizes a grounded answer from the retrieved chunks.

## Design decisions & tradeoffs

### Embedding: ONNX Runtime over sentence-transformers

The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model runs via ONNX Runtime instead of the `sentence-transformers` library.

**Why:** `sentence-transformers` pulls in PyTorch as a dependency. PyTorch CPU-only is ~500MB. ONNX Runtime is ~10MB and runs the same exported model directly. At container build time this matters significantly — a Docker image that installs PyTorch just for inference is solving the wrong problem.

**Tradeoff:** ONNX models can't be fine-tuned at runtime. If you need to adapt the embedding model to a specific domain (e.g., medical or legal terminology), you'd fine-tune with PyTorch and export to ONNX as a build step. For general-purpose documentation search, the base model is sufficient.

**Fallback chain:** `ONNXEmbedding → SentenceTransformerEmbedding → HashEmbedding`. The factory tries each level in order. In tests, `HashEmbedding` runs with zero dependencies — no model download, no GPU, deterministic output.

---

### Vector store: ChromaDB over Pinecone / pgvector

**Why ChromaDB:** Runs in-process, persists to disk, zero external dependencies. The alternative patterns each have a cost:

| Option | Good for | Problem |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Pinecone | Managed, scalable | External service, cost, vendor lock-in |
| pgvector | Already have Postgres | Query complexity, separate index tuning |
| Weaviate | Rich filtering | Heavy to operate |
| ChromaDB | Local / single-instance | Not horizontally scalable |

ChromaDB is the right call when the deployment is a single container or a single-tenant service. The moment you need multiple API workers sharing the same vector store, you'd switch to a server-mode ChromaDB or Pinecone.

**Similarity metric: cosine, not L2.**

Cosine similarity measures the *angle* between vectors — it ignores magnitude. Two documents that say the same thing with different verbosity have the same direction but different magnitude. L2 (Euclidean distance) would score them differently. For semantic similarity, direction is meaning; magnitude is noise.

---

### Chunking: size 500, overlap 50

Text is split into 500-character chunks with a 50-character overlap between consecutive chunks.

**Why overlap:** A sentence that sits on a chunk boundary gets split. Without overlap, searching for content from that sentence might return neither chunk with good relevance. Overlap ensures boundary content appears in both adjacent chunks.

**The size tradeoff:**

- **Too small (< 100 chars):** Individual sentences lose context. "It does not support this." — support *what*? The LLM gets fragments without enough information.
- **Too large (> 1000 chars):** One chunk covers multiple topics. A query about topic A retrieves a chunk that's 80% about topic B, reducing precision. Also, each chunk becomes a larger slice of the LLM's context window.
- **500 chars:** Roughly 2-4 sentences. Enough context, specific enough to score well on a single-topic query.

---

### Relevance threshold: max_distance filter

ChromaDB always returns the top-k closest chunks — even when the query is completely unrelated to the indexed content. Without a threshold, asking *"what is the capital of France?"* against a Python documentation index would still retrieve chunks and send them to the LLM, which would then produce a hallucinated or confused answer.

The `max_distance` parameter (default `0.8`) discards any chunk whose cosine distance exceeds the threshold before the guard clause runs:

```python
# vector_store.py — applied after ChromaDB query
if distance > max_distance:
    continue  # chunk is not semantically related, discard
```

**The tradeoff:** `0.8` was chosen empirically for general documentation. A tighter threshold (`0.5`) reduces noise but may discard valid chunks for niche queries. A looser threshold (`1.0`) accepts more context but risks sending irrelevant chunks to the LLM. The value is exposed as a per-request parameter so callers can tune it for their domain.

**Why this exposed a test limitation:** `HashEmbedding` (used in tests to avoid model downloads) produces vectors based on SHA-256 — no semantic meaning, all distances are effectively random. Tests that assert LLM behavior must explicitly pass `max_distance=2.0` to bypass the filter. This is documented in the test code and is a known, intentional tradeoff of hash-based mock embeddings.

---

### Guard clause before LLM call

```python
if not docs:
    return AskResponse(answer="No relevant documentation found...")
```

If the vector search returns nothing after the distance filter, the LLM is never called.

**Why this matters:**

1. **Cost:** An LLM call with an empty context still charges tokens for the prompt template.
2. **Hallucination:** A well-prompted LLM *might* still answer from its training data when given no context. That's the wrong behavior for a documentation API — the answer should come from your docs, not from the model's general knowledge.
3. **Signal:** "No relevant documentation found" tells the user exactly what happened. An LLM-generated "I don't have information about this" is vaguer and costs 10x more to produce.

---

### Idempotent indexing: delete-before-upsert

Re-indexing the same `source_id` deletes all existing chunks first, then inserts the new ones.

**Why:** If a document is updated and re-indexed without deleting the old chunks, old and new chunks coexist. A query might retrieve an outdated chunk alongside a new one, producing a contradictory answer.

**The tradeoff:** There's a brief window between delete and upsert where the source has zero chunks. During that window, a concurrent `/ask` query would return "no relevant documentation found" for that source. For a single-writer, low-concurrency use case, this is acceptable. For high-concurrency systems, an atomic swap strategy (write to a temp collection, then rename) would be safer.

---

### Dependency injection with `Depends()` and `@lru_cache`

Every service dependency (embedding, vector store, LLM client, chunker) is wired through FastAPI's `Depends()`.

**Why `@lru_cache` on factory functions:** Each factory function is called once per process and the result is cached. This gives singleton behavior without a global variable — the same pattern as a DI container, without a framework.

**Why this enables clean testing:** FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` only works when routes declare their dependencies via `Depends()`. Direct function calls in route handlers bypass the override mechanism entirely. With `Depends()`, every integration can be swapped in tests:

```python
# In tests: no API key, no model download, no disk I/O
app.dependency_overrides = {
    get_vector_store: lambda: DocsVectorStore(EphemeralClient(), collection_name=uuid),
    get_embedding_service: lambda: HashEmbedding(),
    get_llm_client: lambda: mock_llm,
}
```

**The `@lru_cache` tradeoff:** Singletons are process-scoped. With `uvicorn --workers 4`, each worker process has its own ChromaDB client pointing to the same directory. For a single persistent ChromaDB directory, multiple writers can cause corruption. The solution for multi-worker deployments is ChromaDB server mode (HTTP client) or an external vector store.

## Running locally

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/semantic-docs-api
cd semantic-docs-api

cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

docker compose up
```

API at `http://localhost:8000` — Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Run the end-to-end demo

With the API running, execute the demo script to see the full pipeline in action:

```bash
bash examples/demo.sh
```

It indexes two documents, asks questions (including a filtered query and an out-of-scope question that triggers the fallback), re-indexes to verify idempotency, and deletes a source — all with pass/fail output.

### Without Docker

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

---

## Running tests

No API key needed. Tests use in-memory ChromaDB (isolated per test via UUID collection names), hash-based embeddings, and a mocked LLM client.

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Known limitations & production considerations

This project is intentionally scoped as a single-tenant, single-instance service. The following are the gaps between this implementation and a production-grade deployment, and the reasoning behind each.

**No authentication**
Every request has full read/write access to the index. In production, you'd add API key validation as FastAPI middleware — each key maps to a tenant, and every ChromaDB query includes a `tenant_id` metadata filter to isolate data.

**ChromaDB runs in-process with a single writer**
`chromadb.PersistentClient` writes directly to disk. With `uvicorn --workers N`, each worker process has its own client instance pointing to the same directory — concurrent writes can corrupt the index. The fix is ChromaDB server mode (one HTTP server, N clients) or replacing ChromaDB with a managed vector store (Pinecone, Weaviate cloud) behind an interface.

**Character-based chunking**
Splitting at 500 characters can break mid-sentence or mid-code block. A better approach is semantic chunking: split by paragraph, then merge small paragraphs, then split oversized ones. This requires a tokenizer-aware splitter (e.g., LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with token counting).

**No re-ranking**
The retrieval step uses a bi-encoder (fast, approximate). For higher precision, a cross-encoder re-ranker (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) can re-score the top-k results before sending them to the LLM. The tradeoff is latency: cross-encoders are 10-50x slower than bi-encoders.

**No LLM response streaming**
`AnthropicClient.generate()` waits for the full response before returning. For a user-facing product, streaming the response token-by-token (using `client.messages.stream()`) would significantly improve perceived latency.

**No RAG evaluation**
There is no measurement of retrieval quality or answer faithfulness. In production, you'd integrate a framework like [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) to track metrics like context precision, context recall, and answer relevance over a golden dataset.

**`max_distance=0.8` is empirical**
The threshold was chosen by testing against general documentation. Different domains (legal, medical, code) have different embedding distributions — the right value should be calibrated per domain using a labeled evaluation set.
